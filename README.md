# CodeSamples
This repository contains code samples of HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
The first sample, sample.js, contains a function from a thrift store website called Thrifty. The function hides or displays products by class name so that Thrifty shoppers can filter their search results.<br/>

<h2>PHP</h2>
The second sample, sample.php, has the code for a custom field in WordPress. This custom field allows the site's administrators to add a featured selection to their page by dynamically pulling in post information. 

<h2>SCSS</h2>
The final sample, sample.scss, is the stylesheet for the featured selection custom field in sample.php.
